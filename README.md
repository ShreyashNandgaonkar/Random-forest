# Random-forest
Random forests algorithms are used for classification and regression. The random forest is an ensemble learning method, composed of multiple decision trees. By averaging out the impact of several decision trees, random forests tend to improve prediction.

I have used indian-diabetes dataset which is available on UCI repository.

Hyperparameters are tuned using random search cv. Moreover, you can try grid search cv too.

Happy learning
